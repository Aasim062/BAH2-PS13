 Project Workflow: High-Resolution Lunar DEM Generation Using Shape-from-Shading with Albedo Learning and DEM Constraints
🧭 Goal:
To develop a novel, scalable, and physics-aware system to generate high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the Moon’s surface using monoscopic lunar imagery from Chandrayaan or LRO missions — especially in regions where stereo data is unavailable.

🧠 Concept Pillars:
Photoclinometry (Shape-from-Shading) for DEM

CNN-based Albedo Estimation for reflectance separation

Low-resolution DEM constraints using surface normals (not absolute height)

Hierarchical, multi-resolution optimization

Lunar-Lambert Reflectance Model (physically grounded)

Shadow-aware correction

🧩 WORKFLOW OVERVIEW
🔹 PHASE 1: Data Preprocessing and Setup
🎯 Objective:
Prepare all inputs — image, metadata, and initial DEM — aligned and ready for analysis.

🔧 Technologies:
ISIS3, GDAL, QGIS, OpenCV, NumPy

✅ Steps:
Image Selection: LRO NAC / Chandrayaan TMC image (mono).

Metadata Extraction: Sun elevation, azimuth, spacecraft viewing angle.

DEM Selection: SLDEM2015 / LOLA (low-res elevation).

Image Preprocessing:

Radiometric correction

Shadow enhancement

Histogram normalization

Alignment: Reproject and co-register DEM with image.

📦 Output:
Aligned mono image

Co-registered low-res DEM

Metadata for reflectance modeling

🔹 PHASE 2: Albedo Map Estimation
🎯 Objective:
Separate surface reflectivity (albedo) from terrain shape for accurate shading analysis.

🔧 Technologies:
PyTorch / TensorFlow (UNet/CNN)

OpenCV (for preprocessing)

✅ Steps:
Train or Fine-tune CNN: Use lunar patches with known DEMs.

Predict Per-pixel Albedo from mono image.

Apply Regularization: Piece-wise constant smoothness where CNN confidence is low.

📦 Output:
Per-pixel albedo map

🔬 Novelty:
Most methods assume constant albedo. This step improves realism in terrain interpretation.

🔹 PHASE 3: Reflectance Modeling
🎯 Objective:
Build a model linking image brightness with surface slope using real lunar physics.

🔧 Technologies:
Python, NumPy, SciPy

✅ Steps:
Implement Lunar-Lambert Reflectance Model

Calculate Expected Brightness for each pixel using slope, Sun angles, and albedo.

Form Cost Function comparing model brightness with actual image brightness.

📦 Output:
Reflectance model ready for optimization

🔹 PHASE 4: Hierarchical Shape-from-Shading (SfS) Optimization
🎯 Objective:
Gradually refine terrain shape (DEM) from coarse to pixel-level accuracy using brightness gradients.

🔧 Technologies:
SciPy, NumPy, Python

Custom Gauss-Seidel solver

✅ Steps:
Create Multi-Resolution Pyramid of image + DEM (e.g., 60m → 0.5m).

At Each Level:

Use Gauss-Seidel relaxation

Match gradient brightness from reflectance model

Update heights using surface normals, not absolute elevation

Propagate Refinement to higher levels with interpolation

📦 Output:
High-resolution DEM at image resolution

🔬 Novelty:
More accurate than absolute DEM constraints

Robust to lighting changes and shadow zones

🔹 PHASE 5: Shadow-Aware Correction & Postprocessing
🎯 Objective:
Refine DEM in dark zones and remove residual artifacts.

🔧 Technologies:
OpenCV (bilateral filter, shadow mask)

QGIS (DEM cleanup)

✅ Steps:
Detect Shadowed Pixels (thresholding + gradient check).

Ignore or De-weight those regions in optimization.

Postprocess DEM:

Bilateral smoothing

Spike/noise removal

Value normalization

📦 Output:
Clean, smoothed, accurate DEM

🔹 PHASE 6: Evaluation and Validation
🎯 Objective:
Quantify accuracy of DEM and demonstrate scientific validity.

🔧 Technologies:
Matplotlib, Plotly, QGIS, Pandas

✅ Steps:
Compare with Reference DEMs (LOLA, NAC DEMs)

Compute Metrics:

RMSE

Gradient consistency

Crater depth vs known values

Create Terrain Profiles and shaded reliefs

📦 Output:
Error maps, comparison plots, slope profiles

🔹 PHASE 7: Presentation and Submission
🎯 Objective:
Showcase value, uniqueness, and execution of your solution.

Lunar terrain modeling is critical for future missions, especially in shadowed and high-interest zones where stereo imaging is unavailable. Our aim is to generate high-resolution DEMs using monoscopic imagery combined with physical and AI-driven reflectance modeling.
